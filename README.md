# OpenGL-Micro-Projects
A collection of micro projects I created to learn about computer graphics and OpenGL. I also created a Python Flask website to serve the compiled webGL projects.

All programming was done inside of CLion. The micro projects are written in C++ using the OpenGL library and then compiled to webassembely using emscripten from the Firefox team. All html and js for the website was created inside of Bootstrap studio.
